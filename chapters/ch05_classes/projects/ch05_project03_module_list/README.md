# Module List

A course's modules, made from JSON data into Module objects, listed by semester with their total credits - default and optional constructor parameters, and toString inside template literals.

## Running it

Open the project in Celbridge. The console at the bottom starts by itself, and runs `deno task dev`:

1. **builds** `src/` (TypeScript) and `public/` (HTML, CSS, images) into `dist/`
2. **tests** everything in `tests/`, printing the results in the console (in TAP format) and writing a
   readable report to `test_output/index.html` (and `test_output/summary.md`)
3. **watches** - every time you save a file in `src/`, `public/` or `tests/`, it does it all again

`dist/index.html` opens beside the console. After a rebuild, its preview's **refresh** button lights
up - press it to see your changes. The clipboard icon opens the test report.

The console's buttons: rebuild-and-watch, build once, test once, and lint. To use them while the
watcher is running, press **Ctrl+C** first to stop it.

No server is needed: `dist/` is a plain web page, so you can also open `dist/index.html` in any browser.

## What to look at

- `src/Module.ts` - a default parameter (`credits`) and an optional one (`semester?`), whose
  `undefined` means "all year"
- `src/modules.ts` - `modulesFrom` (data to objects), `modulesIn` (`filter`) and `totalCredits`
  (`reduce`) working on `Module` objects
- `src/main.ts` - each list item's text is `${module}`, which calls `toString()`
- `tests/modules.test.ts` - `join("; ")` on an array of modules uses `toString()` too
