# Marks Table

A class's marks, from a JSON file, shown as a table with grades, the average, the top student, and buttons to sort and filter - using the array methods map, filter, reduce, find and toSorted.

## Running it

Open the project in Celbridge. The console at the bottom starts by itself, and runs `deno task dev`:

1. **builds** `src/` (TypeScript) and `public/` (HTML, CSS, images) into `dist/`
2. **tests** everything in `tests/`, printing the results in the console (in TAP format) and writing a
   readable report to `test_output/index.html` (and `test_output/summary.md`)
3. **watches** - every time you save a file in `src/`, `public/` or `tests/`, it does it all again

`dist/index.html` opens beside the console. After a rebuild, its preview's **refresh** button lights
up - press it to see your changes. The clipboard icon opens the test report.

The console's buttons: rebuild-and-watch, build once, test once, and lint. To use them while the
watcher is running, press **Ctrl+C** first to stop it.

No server is needed: `dist/` is a plain web page, so you can also open `dist/index.html` in any browser.

## What to look at

- `src/marks.ts` - `type Student`, and `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `find` and `toSorted`, each given
  an arrow function
- `src/main.ts` - `render()` chains `map` and `join` to build the table; two booleans hold the state
- `tests/marks.test.ts` - a small made-up class, the average of no marks, and a check that sorting
  leaves the original array alone
